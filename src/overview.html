        <p>The jmyapi library is a pure Java implementation of the Mya (JLab EPICS archiver) client query API.  The API is not identical to the C++ query API myapi.</p>
        <div>
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>
                The jmyapi library is distributed as a jar file with accompanying lib and config directories.
                The library requires Java 8 or greater.
            </p>
            <p>
                The versioning is organized into "major.minor" where major 
                versions indicate API changes and minor versions are for bug 
                fixes and implementation changes.
            </p>

            <h2>Configuration</h2>
            <p>
                Java properties files named deployments.properties and credentials.properties are located in the config directory.
            </p>      
            <h2>Source Code</h2>
            <p>The Java jmyapi library repository is named <em>jmyapi</em> 
                and is stored in the JeffersonLab github repository.
            </p>
            <p>
                An Apache Ant build file (build.xml) is used to compile and
                package the library.
            </p>
